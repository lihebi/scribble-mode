#+TITLE: scribble-mode.el

This file is written by Neil, from
[[https://www.neilvandyke.org/scribble-emacs/][the page of his
website]]. The file is under LGPLv3 as put by Neil.

I put it here for 2 reasons:
- The straight.el package manager only supports git backend, so I have
  to have a git repo for it.
- A git repo is also helpful as I would probably improve it.
