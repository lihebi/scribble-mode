#+TITLE: scribble-mode.el

This file is written by Neil, from
[[https://www.neilvandyke.org/scribble-emacs/][the page of his
website]]. The file is under LGPLv3 as put by Neil.

I put it here for 2 reasons:
- The straight.el package manager only supports git backend, so I have
  to have a git repo for it.
- A git repo is also helpful as I would probably improve it.

* TODO list

** fill-paragraph

for @item list

** tab for indent

** literal programming code support

code highlighting, reindent code

** Maybe just use drracket?

Try to support scribble properly seems to be a lot of work. And I do
not want to write elisp.

So probably try to use drracket. I would add the following to Drracket

*** paredit
*** eval C-x C-e
*** drracket performance issues

On my pretty powerful laptop DrRacket in racket v7.4 is very slow in
terms of GUI responsiveness.

*** C-h k (describe-key)
